# bluetooth



## motivation
It would be really nice to have a better understanding of why my various bluetooth headphones have weird behavior around pairing/unpairing, switching to headset mode, having multiple devices connected, etc.
Sniffing and analyzing the packets would probably be very helpful to understand this?

Also, it would be cool to build a bluetooth audio mixer kind of thing.
A device that connects directly to all the bluetooth audio sources/sinks and allows me to route audio from any source to any sink.
(And maybe also, throw in wired audio input/output, too.)



## how to sniff bluetooth packets?
probably using an [ubertooth](https://greatscottgadgets.com/ubertoothone/) is the best way

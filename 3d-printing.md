## thread sizes

### broom stick handle
broom stick handle thread: 3/4" and 5 threads per inch

> Apparently there are two standards common in the USA, both based on a 3/4" dowel (0.75 inch or 19mm). One standard (shown here) has a pitch of 5 threads per inch; the other has 4 threads per inch. However, there is a LOT of variation due to the manufacturing of wood, plastic, milled aluminum, and cast aluminum tools on the market.

I have two different broom stick handles (I think both came from home depot) and they are both 5 threads per inch.
The diameter differs a bit, though, but these threads are usually pretty loose anyway, and 3D printers aren't great at making precisely-sized holes, so not sure that's real.

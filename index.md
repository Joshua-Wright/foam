This is where I brain-dump stuff that I learn, and put links to cool things that I find on the internet, along with my thoughts about them.
It is intended for future-me to refer back to, but if you find the information here helpful, that's cool too.
(none of the information here is guaranteed to be accurate or even reasonable, no warranty, etc)


this wiki is generated using [foam](https://github.com/foambubble/foam).
This is how I interact with it, and if you're looking for some particular information, you're probably best off cloning [the github repo for this site](https://github.com/joshua-wright/wiki) and interacting with it that way.
This provides various useful features like backlinks tracking, search, and also just having a better list of all the files.

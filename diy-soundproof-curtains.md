# DIY soundproof curtains

# motivation
* want to block out low frequency noise (such as from HVAC systems and road noise)
* but soundproof curtains are expensive
* and it doesn't seem like they are that complicated, so it should be possible to make a cheaper DIY version

basic idea: moving blankets are heavy and should be able to block out noise

moving blankets don't absorb sound very well... but neither does most other stuff, so it's probably a good option.
And I can of course use a bunch of layers, since moving blankets are relatively cheap.


Why curtains specifically? so that I can easily move them out of the way in case I need to get to something that's behing them.
Therefore I am free to cover electrical outlets, windows, doors, lightswitches, etc.

# which moving blanket to buy
harbor freight option is way cheaper than alternatives
* https://www.harborfreight.com/72-inch-x-80-inch-movers-blanket-66537.html
* it doesn't say the actual weight, but based on the shipping weight (5.55 lb), it should be about 60lb/dozen
* and it's only $8.59 each
* no grommets, though, so I'll have to install those myself
  * grommet kits: https://www.harborfreight.com/12-in-grommet-installation-kit-104-pc-63237.html https://www.harborfreight.com/grommet-pliers-with-100-grommets-66707.html
  * if I'm installing a whole bunch of grommets I probably want an arbor press https://www.harborfreight.com/1-ton-arbor-press-3552.html
    * (I also just want an arbor press in general lol)

# curtain rod systems
* I would like a system that would allow me to cover the whole length of my walls in one stretch, so that I don't have any gaps where sound would get through.
  * this probably also means the curtain rod will need to be supported in the middle
  * It seems like curtail rail/track systems are the most common way to do this?

potential curtain options:
* Ikea VIDGA https://www.ikea.com/us/en/cat/track-systems-18893/
  * multiple sections can be joined together for longer lengths
  * wall clamps can (must) be added in the middle,not just at the ends of the track
    * there's ceiling clamps available too https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/vidga-ceiling-bracket-white-90299091/
  * there's a corner piece available: https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/vidga-single-track-with-corner-connector-white-s79166403/
  * con: it doesn't look like it can support a whole lot of weight
    * could maybe solve this by using more roller hooks than it recommends?




# alternatives
* DIY encased insulation
  * something like this I think https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spg4y5_zsMs
  * that kind of insulation can generally be dangerous/toxic/caustic/whatever though
  * and these kinds of panels are small compared to curtains, so it would require a lot of them to cover a wall
  * and they obscure electrical outlets and doors and stuff.
* for windows: magnetic panels, such as https://magnetite.com/gallery/

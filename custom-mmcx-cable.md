# custom MMCX cable

# motivation
because most cables for earbuds are very microphonic (vibrations in the cable transmit through the earbuds as noise)

plan: make a custom cable for earbuds
* Etymotic ER3XR IEMs are the ones that I like. They have MMCX connectors
* must make my own cable from connectors and wire, so that I can select the best, most flexible wire available


# other options
* use (or adapt) an existing ultra-thin cable

* maybe get a plug/jack connector pair, and just make a right-angle adapter for the etymotic earbuds?
  * or maybe, MMCX to 2pin adapter? if that's easier


# unknowns
* What does the impedance of a connector mean? and how is it relevant for audio applications?

* straight (not right angle) ones, but they are much shorter overall, which might be nice
